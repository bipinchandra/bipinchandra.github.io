    details: "<p>Our integration services involve successful sharing of processes and data among different applications in an enterprise setting. A number of large scale solutions involve hardware and applications involving disparate technologies and architectures requiring exchange of data and processes. To enable a seamless integration between these various components while achieve overall solution and business goals is a critical component in any large scale deployment.</p> <p>Software integration services help customers leverage the performance of applications to meet business objectives. Every business function does not warrant a custom application and there are companies that need to incorporate established software packages into their systems. Esyasoft provides software integration services for seamless business operation as in today's enterprise infrastructure; system and application integration is more and more frequently a mission critical concern.</p>"
    details_sec: "<p>Some tools that we have used for software integration</p> <p> Location Transparency: A way of centrally configuring endpoints for messages, so that a consumer application does not require information about a message producer in order to receive messages</p> <p>Transformation: The ability to convert messages into a format that is usable by the consumer application.</p> <p>Protocol Conversion: Similar to the transformation requirement, the ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) must be able to accept messages sent in all major protocols, and convert them to the format required by the end consumer. </p> <p>Routing: The ability to determine the appropriate end consumer or consumers based on both pre-configured rules and dynamically created requests. </p> <p> Enhancement: The ability to retrieve missing data in incoming messages, based on the existing message data, and appends it to the message before delivery to its final destination. </p> <p>Monitoring / Administration: The goal of ESB is to make integration a simple task. As such, an ESB must provide an easy method of monitoring the performance of the system, the flow of messages through the ESB architecture, and a simple means of managing the system in order to deliver its proposed value to an infrastructure. </p> <p> Security: ESB security involves two main components - making sure the ESB itself handles messages in a fully secure manner, and negotiating between the security assurance systems used by each of the systems that will be integrated.</p>"
